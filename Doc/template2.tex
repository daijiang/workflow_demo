% Table formatting:
% What if you make a table? -- Pandoc knows, of course, and
% then declares that its variable `table` is True and
% imports a table package suitable to its pleasantly simple tables.
% Needless to say infinitely complicated tables are possible in
% LaTeX with suitable packages. We are spared the temptation:
 
$if(tables)$
\usepackage{array}
 
% Continuing on the topic of tables ... (we havent reached `endif`).
% The commented out line below is in the default pandoc latex.template.
% Some unpleasantness with table formatting must be corrected.
 
% -- This is needed because raggedright in table elements redefines \\:
\newcommand{\PreserveBackslash}[1]{\let\temp=\\#1\let\\=\temp}
\let\PBS=\PreserveBackslash
 
$endif$
 
 
% Subscripts:
% Pandoc remembers whether you used subscripts, assigning True to
% its `subscript` variable
% It then needs to adopt a default with an incantation like this:
$if(subscript)$
\newcommand{\textsubscr}[1]{\ensuremath{_{\scriptsize\textrm{#1}}}}
$endif$
 
 
% Web-style links:
 
% markdown inclines us to use links, since our texts can be made into html.
% Why not have clickable blue links even in
% learned, scientific, religious, juridical, poetical and other suchlike texts?
% Never mind that they have been proven to destroy the nervous system!
 
% First, what about the fact that links like http://example.com are
% technically code and thus must not be broken across lines?
% [breaklinks=true] to the rescue!
 
% Nowadays LaTeX can handle all of this with another half million macros:
 
\usepackage[breaklinks=true]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{colorlinks,%
	citecolor=blue,%
	filecolor=blue,%
	linkcolor=blue,%
	urlcolor=blue}
		
$if(url)$
\usepackage{url}
$endif$
 
 
 
% Images.
% In ye olde LaTeX one could only import a limited range of image
% types, e.g. the forgotten .eps files. Or else one simply drew the image
% with suitable
% commands and drawing packages. Today we want to import .jpg files we make
% with
% our smart phones or whatever:
 
$if(graphics)$
\usepackage{graphicx}
% -- We will generate all images so they have a width \maxwidth. This means
% -- that they will get their normal width if they fit onto the page, but
% -- are scaled down if they would overflow the margins.
\makeatletter
\def\maxwidth{\ifdim\Gin@nat@width>\linewidth\linewidth
	\else\Gin@nat@width\fi}
	\makeatother
	\let\Oldincludegraphics\includegraphics
	\renewcommand{\includegraphics}[1]{\Oldincludegraphics[width=\maxwidth]{#1}}
	$endif$
	 
	 

% Section numbering.
% Here again is a variable you can specify on the commandline
% `markdown2pdf my.txt --number-sections --xetex
% --template=/wherever/this/is -o my.pdf`
$if(numbersections)$
$else$
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}
$endif$

% Footnotes:
% Wait, didn't we already discuss the crisis of code in footnotes?
% Evidently the order of unfolding of macros required that
% we import a package to deal with them earlier
% and issue a command it defines now. (Or maybe that's not the reason;
	% very often the order does matter as the insane system of macro
	% expansion
	% must take place by stages.)
$if(verbatim-in-note)$
\VerbatimFootnotes % -- allows verbatim text in footnotes
$endif$

% Other stuff you specify on the command line:
% You can include stuff for the header from a file specified on the
% command line;
% I've never done this, but that stuff will go here:
$for(header-includes)$
$header-includes$
$endfor$

% Title, authors, date.
% If you specified title authors and date at the start of
% your pandoc-markdown file, pandoc knows the 'values' of the
% variables: title authors date and fills them in.

$if(title)$
\title{$title$}
$endif$
\author{$for(author)$$author$$sep$\\$endfor$}
$if(date)$
\date{$date$}
$endif$

% At last:
% The document itself!:

% After filling in all these blanks above, or erasing them
% where they are not needed, Pandoc has finished writing the
% famous LaTeX *preamble* for your document.
% Now comes the all-important command \begin{document}
% which as you can see, will be paired with an \end{document} at the end.
% Pandoc knows whether you have a title, and has already
% specified what it is; if so, it demands that the title be rendered.
% Pandoc knows whether you want a table of contents, you
% specify this on the command line.
% Then, after fiddling with alignments, there comes the real
% business: pandoc slaps its rendering of your text in the place of
% the variable `body`
% It then concludes the document it has been writing.
